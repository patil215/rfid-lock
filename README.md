# RFID Lock

I didn't want to carry my keys around, so I built an RFID lock into my dorm room door.

This project contains the source code behind the Arduino-powered lock. Since I wasn't allowed to destructively modify my door, I tried to design the project to be as easily removable and minimally invasive as possible.

The lock consists of an Arduino Uno connected to a high-torque servo motor. The motor is connected to a four bar mechanism. The mechanism fits over the lock piece of my dorm room door, so that when the servo rotates, the lock piece does as well. I 3D printed the four bar mechanism and fitting over the door lock, and used small 1/4-20 nuts and bolts as the pivots. The RFID chip is an $8 component available off of Amazon.

Here's a video of the lock in operation:

As well as a couple of pictures:
